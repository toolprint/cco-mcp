# Complexity Report for CCO-MCP Entry Point Files

## Overview

This report analyzes the complexity of the main entry point files in the CCO-MCP project.

## File Analysis

### 1. src/index.ts
- **Purpose**: Main entry point that starts the Express server
- **Lines of Code**: ~10
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Dependencies**: Express app from app.ts
- **Key Functions**: 
  - Server initialization
  - Port and host configuration
  - Server startup logging

### 2. src/app.ts
- **Purpose**: Express application setup and middleware configuration
- **Lines of Code**: ~90
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Express framework
  - MCP SDK (StreamableHTTPServerTransport)
  - Routes (audit, SSE)
  - Server (MCP server instance)
  - Logger
- **Key Functions**:
  - Express middleware setup
  - Route mounting (/api, /mcp endpoints)
  - MCP request handling
  - Graceful shutdown handling

### 3. src/server.ts
- **Purpose**: MCP server implementation with approval_prompt tool
- **Lines of Code**: ~100
- **Complexity**: Medium-High
- **Dependencies**:
  - MCP SDK (McpServer)
  - Zod for validation
  - Audit log service
  - Logger
- **Key Functions**:
  - MCP server creation
  - approval_prompt tool implementation
  - Polling logic for approval status
  - Environment variable handling

## Complexity Metrics

### Cyclomatic Complexity (Estimated)
- **index.ts**: 1 (linear execution)
- **app.ts**: 5-7 (multiple route handlers, error handling)
- **server.ts**: 8-10 (polling loop, multiple conditional branches)

### Maintainability Index (Estimated)
- **index.ts**: 90+ (Very maintainable - simple and focused)
- **app.ts**: 70-80 (Good maintainability - clear separation of concerns)
- **server.ts**: 60-70 (Moderate - complex polling logic but well-structured)

## Key Observations

### Strengths
1. **Clear separation of concerns**: Each file has a specific purpose
2. **Good error handling**: Proper try-catch blocks and error responses
3. **Type safety**: Full TypeScript usage with proper types
4. **Graceful shutdown**: SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers implemented
5. **Configurable**: Environment variables for key settings

### Areas for Potential Improvement
1. **Polling mechanism**: Could be refactored to use promises more elegantly
2. **Error messages**: Could be centralized for consistency
3. **Validation**: Input validation could be extracted to separate middleware
4. **Testing**: No unit tests present (as noted in package.json)

## Recommendations

1. **Add unit tests**: Especially for the approval polling logic
2. **Extract constants**: Move magic numbers and strings to constants file
3. **Add request logging middleware**: For better debugging
4. **Consider dependency injection**: For easier testing and flexibility
5. **Add API versioning**: Prepare for future API changes

## Conclusion

The codebase shows good architectural decisions with reasonable complexity levels. The separation between HTTP server setup (app.ts), MCP integration (server.ts), and entry point (index.ts) provides good modularity. The most complex component is the approval polling mechanism in server.ts, which could benefit from additional testing and potentially some refactoring for clarity.
